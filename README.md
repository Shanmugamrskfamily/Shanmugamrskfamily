# 💫 About Me:
🌱 I'm currently learning Fullstack Development with a focus on the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js).<br>My journey began in May 2023 through a program with Guvi-IITM, and I've been passionately exploring the world of web development since then.<br><br>👯 I'm looking to collaborate on exciting projects that involve innovative web applications and cutting-edge technologies.<br>I believe in the power of teamwork and am eager to contribute my skills to collaborative ventures.<br><br>🤝 I'm looking for help with deepening my understanding of backend development, particularly honing my skills in <br>Node.js and Express. Any guidance or resources in this area would be greatly appreciated.<br><br>💬 Ask me about my transition from being an Operating Engineer in the tire manufacturing industry to embarking<br> on a journey in tech, or anything related to fullstack development and the MERN stack. I'm always excited to share <br>my experiences and learn from others.<br><br>⚡ Fun fact: Despite my background in the manufacturing sector, I've found a newfound passion in coding and creating <br>digital solutions. When I'm not immersed in coding, you might find me exploring the outdoors or trying out new recipes in the kitchen.<br><br>Feel free to connect, collaborate, or strike up a conversation about anything tech-related or even exchange some fun facts! 🚀👨‍💻
